# Vehicular vanguard

This is my current passion project, it's currently just a vehicle editor, but i hope that it'll be so much more in the future.
## Name
I'm very bad at naming things, so I decided to ask ChatGPT to help me with the name, and  it generated the absolutely genius name 'Vehicular Vanguard'.
A few reasons why it's genius:
 1) The vehicular part is pretty self explanotory, vehices ARE the main part of the game
 2) Vanguard evokes a sort of militaristic or combatative idea, which fits the game idea, since combat will be the second biggest part of the game
 3) Vanguard also means at the forefront of something, in this case technologically. I'm hoping to make it so you have to always change your vehicle, stay at the vanguard so to speak
 Thank you again ChatGPT <sub>(I love you so much).</sub>
## The idea
I am hoping to make a Rougelike 3rd person shooter vehicle building game. Sort of a mix between The Binding of Isaac and Crossout.
## Currently implemented
 Currently I implemented:
  - A simple building system, which will hopefully be reowrked
  - A part component system which allows to easily add new parts
  - An action based control system
  - 6 parts (2 structural 4 movement)
  - Editor history (Undo/Redo)
  - Saving and loading of the vehicles  

## Support
I am open sourcing it because I trully belive in the idea of open source, but this also means that I won't be able to actively monetize this game,
So if you find some value in the game or the code please consider donating, I'm not sure about how for now, but reach out and we'll work something out.
