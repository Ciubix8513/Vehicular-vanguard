# Car-game

This is my current passion project, it's currently just a vehicle editor, but i hope that it'll be so much more in the future.
## Name
I don't know how to call the game yet, and i'm really bad with names so it's gonna be 'Car game' for now.
## The idea
I am hoping to make a Rougelike 3rd person shooter vehicle building game. Sort of a mix between The Binding of Isaac and Crossout.
## Currently implemented
 Currently I implemented:
  - A simple building system, which will hopefully be reowrked
  - A part component system which allows to easily add new parts
  - An action based control system
  - 6 parts (2 structural 4 movement)
  - Editor history (Undo/Redo)
  - Saving and loading of the vehicles  

## Support
I am open sourcing it because I trully belive in the idea of open source, but this also means that I won't be able to actively monetize this game,
So if you find some value in the game or the code please consider donating, I'm not sure about how for now, but reach out and we'll work something out.
